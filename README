plibv4/FixedPoint - a class to encapsulate a fixed point number

Floating point numbers are prone to precision errors and therefore are not well
suited for many purposes, especially when doing finance/accountancy.
It is therefore advised to multiply by 100 in finance, cast to int, do additions
with the integers and divide by 100 again for the final result.
Naturally, it's easy to loose track on your way, that's why I encapsulated
a fixed point number into a class for easier and more reliable use.
